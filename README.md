# Indian_Start-up_Analysis

This project is work done by team Gstaad as we ventured into analyzing the Indian start-up market and sought to reject or fail to reject our null hypothesis.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to gather facts before venturing into the Indian Start-up market and provide insights.


### Methods Used
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Univariate Data Analysis
* Multi Variate Data Analysis
* Data Visualization


### Technologies
* Numpy
* Python
* Pandas
* jupyter
* Matplot lib
* JavaScript
* Seaborn

## Project Description

We used data on start-ups from the year 2018,2019,2020 and 2021. The data was cleaned and explored as different data sets that were later combined into one. Some of the problems discovered during EDA were:
1. The prescence of different currencies i.e Rupies and Dollars
2. Missing values  
3. Misplaced values.
After cleaning we used matplot lib to visualize our findings and present them using different graphs.

## Needs of this project


- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- writeup/reporting


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](https://github.com/muchaimaryanne/Indian_Start-up_Analysis/blob/main/India%20Startup%20Funding.zip) within this repo.

     
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](https://github.com/muchaimaryanne/Indian_Start-up_Analysis/blob/main/Funding%20Analysis.ipynb)

##Artical
The company’s data are growing every day. The incoming of data collection, processing, measurement, and analysis technologies has reset the way business is done. Its capabilities have opened frontiers from innovation to productivity and competition. Moreover, these technologies are available at a much cheaper cost, making data a growing torrent flowing into every area of the global economy.
Without big data analytics, companies are blind and deaf, wandering out onto the web like deer on a freeway.”- Geoffrey Moore, management consultant and author of Crossing the Chasm
Basically, it's the data science practitioner roles have more variety and depth. 
Data scientist’s roles don't necessarily means you do research or create complex models, the job expected you to choose the right solution to solve the right problem, whether it's a SQL query, A/B tests, BI dashboard, or Excel table. And if you want to be Data Scientist expert, you are expected to do causal analysis to interpret the results and use engineering skills to scale company’s solutions.
“In the spirit of science, there really is no such thing as a ‘failed experiment.’ Any test that yields valid data is a valid test.” –  Adam Savage, creator of MythBusters.
Think analytically, rigorously, and systematically about a business problem and come up with a solution that leverages the available data.” – Michael O’Connell, chief analytics officer, TIBCO.
In order to be Data scientist that could be the company’s solution, you must meet the following things:
a)	Have technical depth - solve complex problems
b)	Deal with ambiguity - create solutions for vaguely defined problems
c)	Create impact - help the team reach business goals
d)	Help people grow - leadership and mentorship
e)	Have support - your peers and managers know and approve your work
